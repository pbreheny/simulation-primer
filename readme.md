# Primer on simulation design

This is an introduction to how to write and organize a simulation study. It is intended for students who have limited experience carrying out such studies before. However, it may also prove valuable to students who have carried out many simulation studies, but struggle to organize them well. The focus here is almost entirely on the organization. The *science* of designing a good simulation study is obviously also very important, but is a large topic; the primer does contain some links for further reading.
